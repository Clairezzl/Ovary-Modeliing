# Ovary-Modeliing

##Goal of simulation
1. Develop a simulation for large number of control follicles using assumptions about folliculogenesys from the literature
2. Fit the distribution of follicular sizes to data from control rats
3. Modify the parameters of simulation to change the shape of the distribution to fit HFHS data
4. Interpret the parameters which induced change in shape of the distribution and use them to predict the biological mechanism
